# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository uses GitHub Copilot to assist with code generation and productivity. Please follow these guidelines to get the most out of Copilot:

- **Repository Structure Insight for LLMs:**
  - The `Web/` folder contains a React + TypeScript project for my personal website frontend.
  - The `API/` folder is the backend, currently only implementing a "Contact Me" feature (see `API/src/functions/ContactMe.ts`).
- Use Copilot suggestions as a starting point, but always review and test generated code.
- Ensure all code follows the project's style and best practices.
- Do not commit sensitive information or credentials suggested by Copilot.
- For more information, see the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot).
